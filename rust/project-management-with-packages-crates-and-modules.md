# Project Management with Packages, Crates and Modules

## Packages and Crates

* when we run `cargo new my-project`, we have a package that only contains `src/main.rs`. Therefore, we only have a binary crate named `my-project`
* If a package contains `src/main.rs` _and_ `src/lib.rs`, the package contains a library crate with the same name as the package and `src/lib.rs` is its crate root

## Modules

* _paths_ allow us to name items
* the use
